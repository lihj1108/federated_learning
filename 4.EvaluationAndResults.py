"""
To evaluate the effectiveness of the logistic regression model trained using federated learning in identifying high-potential clients, we will employ several standard metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score. These metrics will help us gauge how well the model performs across different branches, considering the potential diversity and imbalances in the data.

Evaluation Method
Metrics Explanation:
Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the model — the ratio of true predictions (both true positives and true negatives) over all predictions.
Precision: Measures the correctness achieved in positive prediction — the ratio of true positives to all predicted positives.
Recall (Sensitivity): Measures the ability of the model to find all the relevant cases (positives) — the ratio of true positives to all actual positives.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall. It is useful when you need to take both precision and recall into account. An F1 score reaches its best value at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0.
Model Testing:
Each branch should test the global model with its local data that was not used during the training phase, to simulate a realistic evaluation scenario.
Given that data might not be perfectly balanced (i.e., the number of high-potential clients may be much lower than low-potential clients), F1 score becomes particularly crucial as it balances the precision and recall, providing a more comprehensive view of model performance.
Implementation
Below is a Python snippet that illustrates how you might evaluate the model after it has been trained. Assuming that you have a function to predict the classes using the trained model:


Analysis and Discussion
When analyzing the results, you would typically compare the metrics across branches to identify any discrepancies. These discrepancies could indicate:

Data distribution differences such as varying client demographics or financial behaviors across branches.
Model bias where the model might be overfitting to specific branches that have more representation in the training data or more homogeneous data.
Impact of non-IID data on model performance where data is not identically distributed across different branches.
To address any observed discrepancies, you may consider strategies like adjusting the local data used for training, implementing different models that might be more robust to data heterogeneities, or employing techniques such as stratified sampling or rebalancing the datasets.

This approach provides a foundation for understanding and improving the federated learning model's performance in realistic banking scenarios, facilitating targeted interventions to enhance model accuracy and fairness across diverse client populations.
