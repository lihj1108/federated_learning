Setting up a Federated Learning (FL) framework involves a few key steps: selecting a model, defining the learning process, and establishing how model updates are handled across different nodes (branches in this case) and aggregated centrally. Here, we'll outline how to create such a framework using Python, focusing on a scenario where each branch predicts "high potential" clients based on financial behaviors.

Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up Federated Learning
Model Selection: We'll use a simple logistic regression model for this binary classification problem, as it is straightforward and efficient for federated settings.
Data Partition: The data remains local at each branch, and each local model is trained on the branch's dataset.
Local Model Training: Each branch trains the model independently on its local data.
Aggregation of Model Updates: After training, only the model parameters (weights) or gradients are sent to a central server where they are averaged to produce a global model.
Repeat Process: The central server sends the updated model back to each branch, and the process is repeated for several iterations.
Federated Learning Implementation
Below is a simplified example using Python, where we simulate federated learning with a focus on local training and central aggregation of updates. We'll use sklearn for the logistic regression model. This is a conceptual implementation and does not include network communications or encryption mechanisms that would be required in a real-world scenario.

Explanation
Local Model Training: Each branch trains a logistic regression model. We assume features such as age, account balance, loan amount, and transaction count are relevant. Loan default status (reversed to indicate high potential) serves as the target variable.
Aggregation: After local training, each branch sends its model coefficients and intercept to a central server where they are averaged. This represents the aggregation step in federated learning.
Iterations: The process is typically repeated multiple times to refine the global model.
This example serves as a basic framework for a federated learning system in Python and needs to be adapted and expanded with security measures and network communication protocols for real-world applications.
