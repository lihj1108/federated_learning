Project Documentation: Federated Learning for Bank Client Potential Analysis
1. Data Preparation
Overview:
We created a synthetic dataset to simulate the client data of three separate bank branches, complying with privacy regulations that prevent data centralization. Each branch dataset included features like account balance, transaction history, loan history, and demographic information, ensuring diversity and realism in the data.

Features:
Client ID: Unique identifier for each client.
Branch: Branch identifier (North, South, East).
Age: Client's age.
Gender: Client's gender.
Account Balance: Current account balance.
Total Loan Amount: Total loans taken by the client.
Number of Transactions Last Month: Count of last month's transactions.
Loan Defaulted: Indicates if a client has defaulted on a loan (Yes/No).
Data Generation:
Using Python libraries (pandas, numpy), we generated data for 100 clients per branch with randomized values for each feature to reflect realistic banking scenarios. The script initializes the parameters, generates data for each branch, and combines it into a single DataFrame.

2. Model Selection
Rationale:
Logistic Regression was chosen due to its efficiency, simplicity, and suitability for binary classification problems like predicting client potential based on financial behaviors. Its interpretability helps understand feature influence on predictions, crucial for deploying models in sensitive areas like banking.

3. Federated Learning Implementation
Setup:
The federated learning framework was designed to train on local datasets at each branch. The branches update a central model without exchanging raw dataâ€”only model parameters (weights and gradients) are shared for aggregation.

Process:
Initialization: A central server initializes global model parameters.
Local Training: Each branch trains the model locally using its dataset.
Aggregation: Model updates are sent to the central server, where they are averaged.
Distribution: The updated global model parameters are sent back to each branch.
Iterations: This cycle is repeated multiple times to refine the model.
Challenges:
Simulating network communication and managing data heterogeneity were significant challenges. We mitigated these by simulating network interactions through direct function calls and ensuring data diversity across branches.

4. Evaluation and Results
Metrics:
We used accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score to evaluate the model across different branches.

Testing:
The global model was evaluated using a subset of data from each branch that was not involved in training. Each branch calculated its respective metrics to analyze model performance and detect discrepancies across branches.

Findings:
The analysis required examining differences in performance metrics to identify potential biases or data distribution issues, addressed by adjusting data or training procedures.

5. Privacy Considerations
Enhancements:
Federated learning inherently enhances privacy by keeping data localized and only sharing model updates.

Vulnerabilities:
Potential vulnerabilities include inference attacks and poisoning attacks. Strategies such as differential privacy, secure multi-party computation, and robust aggregation algorithms were recommended to mitigate these risks.

Security Measures:
Implementing differential privacy and continuous monitoring of the training process were advised to safeguard against vulnerabilities.

6. Conclusion
This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of setting up a federated learning project for identifying high-potential clients in a banking context. The detailed steps and considerations ensure that another engineer can understand the approach and replicate the project, adhering to both technical and regulatory standards.

Usage:
To replicate this project, follow the structured steps outlined in this document, ensure the setup of a Python environment with necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, sklearn), and adapt the synthetic data generation and model parameters as required for your specific use case.
